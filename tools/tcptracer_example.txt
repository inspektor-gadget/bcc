Demonstrations of tcptracer, the Linux eBPF/bcc version.


This tool traces the kernel function performing TCP connections (eg, via a
connect() or accept() syscalls) and closing them (explicitly or if the process
dies). Some example output (IP addresses are fake):

```
# ./tcptracer
T  PID    COMM             IP SADDR            DADDR            SPORT  DPORT
CN 2389   telnet           4  192.168.1.2      192.168.1.1      53404  23
CN 14763  curl             6  ::1              ::1              55782  80
CL 2389   telnet           4  192.168.1.2      192.168.1.1      53404  23
CL 14763  curl             6  ::1              ::1              55782  80
AC 15195  nc               4  10.202.210.1     10.202.109.12    8080   43904
CL 15195  nc               4  10.202.210.1     10.202.109.12    8080   43904

This output shows three conections, one outgoing from a "telnet" process, one
outgoing from "curl", and one incoming received by the "nc" process. The output details show
the kind of event (CN for connection, CL for close and AC for accept), PID, IP
version, source address, destination address, source port and destination port.
